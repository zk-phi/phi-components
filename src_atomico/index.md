# phi-components

A **WIP** component library for my hobby projects.

### Goals

- reasonably light
- builds fast
- framework agnostic (available as both Web Components and Preact components)
- supports dark mode out of the box
- form elements works just like form elements

### Design Principles

- Positive, warm and peaceful vibe
- Not too fancy, meeting wide range of purposes
- Nearly-zero animations, but full of interactions
  - All interactive elements are always distinguishable from plain texts
  - All interactive elements are colored when hovered
  - All interactive elements look differently when pressed
  - Animations can ONLY be used to help user to track what's happening
    - i.e. when element (dis)appears or moves

### Technologies

- Language: `Typescript`
- Bundler: `Vite`
- DOM manipulation: `Preact`
- Style injection: `Goober`
- Web Components wrapper: `preactement`
- Documentation: `Vitepress`
