# phi-components

A WIP component library for my hobby projects.

## Goals

- Comes with developer-friendly interface
- Reasonably light
- Framework-agnostic (available in different levels: Pure-CSS, WebComponents, Preact)
- Supports dark mode out of the box
- Form elements works just as expected

## Design Principles

- Positive, warm and peaceful vibe
- Not too gorgeous, but not too formal, meeting wide range of purposes
- Nearly-zero animations, but full of interactions
  - All interactive elements are ALWAYS distinguishable from plain texts
  - All interactive elements are colored when hovered
  - All interactive elements look differently when pressed
  - Animations are employed ONLY to help user to understand what's happening
    - i.e. when element (dis)appears or moves far

## Technologies

- Language: `TypeScript`, `PostCSS`
- Bundler: `Vite`
- DOM manipulation: `Preact`
- Documentation: `Vitebook`

## License

This is a WIP and not licensed for now (i.e. I don't wanna this library be used for now).

Maybe MIT in the future.
