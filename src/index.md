A WIP component library for my hobby projects.

Available in three different formats (Pure-CSS, WebComponent, Preact).

## Technologies

- Bundler: `Vite`
- DOM manipulation: `Preact`
- Documentation: `Vitebook`

## License

This is a WIP and not licensed for now (i.e. I don't wanna this library be used for now).

Maybe MIT in the future.
