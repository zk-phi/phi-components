# phi-components

A WIP Preact/CSS component library for my hobby projects.

## Goals

- Comes with simple interface
- Builds reasonably fast
- Also available as framework-agnostic CSS-only library
- Supports dark mode out of the box

## Design Principles

- Positive, warm and peaceful vibe
- Not too fancy, but not too formal, meeting wide range of purposes
- Nearly-zero animations, but full of interactions
  - All interactive elements are ALWAYS distinguishable from plain texts
  - All interactive elements are colored when hovered
  - All interactive elements look differently when pressed
  - Animations are ONLY be used to help user to understand what's happening
    - i.e. when element (dis)appears or moves

## Technologies

- Language: `Typescript`, `PostCSS`
- Bundler: `Vite`
- DOM manipulation: `Preact`
- Documentation: `Storybook`
