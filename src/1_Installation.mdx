# Installation

You may add `phi-components` to your project in two ways.

## As a Pure-CSS design system

Just copy `dist/contrib/destyle.css` and `dist/index.css` to your project, and load it.

``` html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="index.css" />
```

## As a Preact components package

Add this package to your project:

``` json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "phi-components": "zk-phi/phi-components#<commit-or-branch-id>"
  }
}
```

and apply the CSS.

``` typescript
import "phi-components/dist/index.css";
```

Then import any component you want.

``` typescript
import { Button } from "phi-components";
```

## NOTICE

`phi-components` includes `destyle.css` to normalize browser default styles, which may affect existing app.

It's not recommended to mix different design systems together in a project.
